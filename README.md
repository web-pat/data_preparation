1. opening a file in the read mode. This is the file that has the duplicates.
2. Then in a loop that runs till the file is over, we check if the line has already encountered.
3. If it has been encountered than we don't write it to the output file.
4. If not we will write it to the output file and add it to the list of records that have been encountered already
